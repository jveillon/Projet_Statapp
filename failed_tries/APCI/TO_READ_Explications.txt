We tried here to perform an Age-Period-Cohort analysis to evaluate the importance of age, period and cohort effects in the time evolution of the health index.

We used the method developed by Liying Luo and James S. Hodges.

All the information we obtained is contained in the data frames "results_Deviance_test", "results_Age_effect", "results_Period_effect", "results_Cohort_effect".

We didn't get any significant effect on the time evolution of the index. That might be due to the construction of the index.
